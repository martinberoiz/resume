### Algorithms developed

[Astroalign:](https://github.com/toros-astro/astroalign) A Python module for the alignment of two stellar images without World Coordinate System information.

[Astronomy broker website:](https://toros.utrgv.edu/broker) A Django website to coordinate the assignment of observational targets for a night of observation between different observatories.

[Refactoring of AutoMix:](https://github.com/quatrope/AutoMix) AutoMix is a Reversible Jump MCMC sampler developed by David Hastie. (C)

[OIS (Optimal Image Subtraction):](https://github.com/toros-astro/ois) A Python module to find transient events on stellar images. Uses modern Image Difference Analysis techniques.

[Software pipeline for reduction and analysis of astronomical images](https://github.com/toros-astro/toritos). Algorithms developed: Optimal Image Differencing and Machine Learning classifier. (Python, Django web app)

Bayesian analysis to estimate the influence of calibration errors on LIGO gravitational wave data. (C++)

Spectral Method modeling algorithm to numerically solve a 2D helically-reduced wave equation on different geometries with mixed boundary conditions (Fortran algorithms added to a pre existing repository of spectral method routines, SVN, Mathematica).

Numerical integrator of time-like geodesics (light paths) around a rotating black hole. 3D representa- tion of the geodesic using OpenGL in an interactive OS X GUI. (C, Objective-C, OpenGL)

Prototype algorithm for a real-time radio pulse detection, searching for “dispersion measure” signature in transient astronomical signals. (C, PGPLOT, FFTW, OpenMP)
